title: principles with another
author: Pumla Maswanganyi edited by Cherné Africa, from with another.
overview: In an era where the rate of creation often eclipses reflection, we believe in a deliberate, process-led approach to design.  Design, as both an intellectual and material practice, carries with it the power to shape worlds—not just through objects, but through narratives, cultures, and systems. It is our responsibility to engage with this power in a way that is grounded in ethics, purpose, and inclusivity.
    Our work is rooted in four guiding principles: Acknowledgement or Furtherance, Course and Effect, Multi-Sensory Materialism, and Joint Wisdom and Custodianship. These principles serve as a framework for creating propositions that are built in the present, and made to resonate through time, thus contributing to empowered futures with the Global Majority in mind.

principles:
- principle: Acknowledgement or Furtherance
  summary: | 
    Consultancy: Engaging with context to propose relevant futures.
Studio: Exploring dynamic archives of place, past and people.  
    When we design, we must acknowledge the intertwined layers of history, and culture that have shaped the present. The principle of Acknowledgement or Furtherance asks us to reflect on a system and environment’s inherited foundations—celebrating and furthering those aspects that deserve continuation, while also recognising what must change. 
    In this reflective process, we are guided by the question: What kind of ancestor do you want to be? It is not enough to simply contribute to the present. We must also be conscious custodians of the future, developing canons that build upon existing lexicons and archives. These archives, whether tangible or ephemeral, are not static—they are living entities that we continually add to, ensuring that we contribute to future heritages with care, dignity, and intention.
- principle: Course and Effect
  summary: |
    Consultancy: Intentional methodologies shaping desired outcomes.
  Studio: Process as medium for adaptive making.
    Design is not an arbitrary act. It is a methodical process where each decision and every element included in the process, contributes to a desired outcome. This notion of Course and Effect emphasises that the journey of creation is as significant as the final result. Our commitment is to a design methodology that deliberately curates essentials—those elements that are truly beneficial and necessary, allowing space for the design to breathe, evolve, and ultimately reflect the desired future.
    By incorporating this taxonomy of essentials, we ensure that each part of the design process serves a distinct, well-considered purpose. Every element is intentional, guided by the material, cultural, and environmental contexts in which we operate. In this way, our designs are not just objects or artefacts, but legacies—thoughtfully crafted and poised to stand the test of time.
- principle: Multi-Sensory Materialism
  summary: |
    Consultancy: Integrating sensory intelligence into design.
Studio: Merging material presence with sensory perception.
    In a world that often privileges the visual and solely thought-based reality, we advocate for a broader understanding of the senses and materiality. Multi-Sensory Materialism recognises that the materials from which we shape our world, extend beyond the physical to include elements we cannot see or touch—such as air, ideas, and emotions. Our approach embraces the richness of this full spectrum of sensory experience that is uniquely human.
    Design should not flatten our sensory realities. Instead, it should enhance them. By embracing multidimensional experiences, we create inclusive imaginaries that resonate with diverse sensory modalities, cultures, needs, and ways of being. In doing so, we reject the tendency toward sensory reductionism and instead promote designs that engage all aspects of ourselves, understanding that tangible experience far eclipses  conceptual understanding.
- principle: Joint Wisdom and Custodianship
  summary: |
   Consultancy: Ensuring longevity through collective responsibility.
Studio: Conscious continuous custodianship over ownership.
    No design exists in isolation. It is a product of collaboration, and at the heart of our process is the principle of Joint Wisdom and Custodianship. We recognise that wisdom and expertise are not the sole purview of designers, but are embedded in the culture, land, and experiences of the communities and institutions with whom we work. Our practice values a reciprocal exchange of knowledge, creating a cyclical relationship of learning that empowers all parties.
    In this mutual exchange, everyone involved in the process becomes a custodian of the final creation. This is not a top-down approach, but one that acknowledges and integrates diverse voices, ensuring that the designs we produce reflect a collective heritage. By prioritising joint custodianship, we foster a design process that is not only inclusive but also regenerative. A process where all parties feel empowered to cultivate and evolve the proposition over time, each in their unique ways.
- closing statement: The principles do not follow a hierarchy and rather exist as a flexible framework, adaptable to both structured problem-solving and creative exploration. While they can be applied sequentially for a methodical approach, each principle also holds its own integrity, capable of guiding decisions independently.

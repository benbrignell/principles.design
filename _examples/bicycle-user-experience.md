  summary: Consider the broader context of each cycling journey, including the surrounding environment, trip goals, and qualitative factors that influence user experience. Adapt infrastructure to fit the unique needs of each context.
- principle: Continuous Learning
  summary: Promote a culture of ongoing development and improvement. Regularly gather feedback, conduct research, and evaluate cycling infrastructure to ensure it remains effective and user-friendly.
- principle: Practical Application
  summary: Equip urban mobility professionals with actionable methods and tools to integrate user experience into their planning and design processes. Focus on practical, adaptable solutions that can be applied in various local contexts.
- principle: Collaborative Design

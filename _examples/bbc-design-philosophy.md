principles:
- principle: Universal
  summary: Our messages are clear and are communicated through simple, useful and intuitive interfaces. Our services are inherently open and accessible.
- principle: Compelling
  summary: Our voice ranges from serious and authoritative through to witty and entertaining. We sound authentic and relevant, warm and human. We engage our audiences with compelling storytelling.
- principle: Authentic
  summary: We value the familiarity and trust placed in us. We acknowledge the BBC's heritage of iconic design and broadcasting history with subtle references.
- principle: Pioneering
  summary: We pioneer design innovations that surprise and delight. We introduce the unexpected but always take our audiences with us.
- principle: Current
  summary: We curate a timeline of Britain; reflecting the present as it happens and adding relevant contextual links with the past.
- principle: Distinctive
  summary: We stand out by looking to tomorrow instead of simply referencing the design trends of today. We strike a balance between cookie-cutter design and beautiful anarchy.
- principle: Joined-up
  summary: All our services and platforms are one connected whole which deliver experiences sensitive to their context of use. We enable coherent journeys both within and outside familiar paths. We connect our audiences where there are shared interests and experiences.
- principle: Local / Global
  summary: We need to speak to everyone but we recognise the individual. Our message is scalable and localisable.
- principle: Modern British
  summary: Our services are woven into the fabric of everyday life in the UK. They embrace a modern British design aesthetic that extends outside national boundaries. Our character is vibrant and sometimes quirky.
- principle: Best
  summary: Last but not least we put quality first.

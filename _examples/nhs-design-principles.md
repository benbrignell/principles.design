overview: | 
        These principles guide all of our design. Use them to get started on a project and to help with making decisions.
        
        They're inspired by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england">NHS Constitution</a> that's steered the NHS for 70 years.

principles:
- principle: Put people at the heart of everything you do 
  summary: |
    Patients, family, carers, staff. Design things that understand and respect people's needs. Take the time to learn about the whole person - their emotional, physical and technical needs.

    Design with compassion. 
- principle: Design for the outcome 
  summary: |
    What will good look like? What are the health, wellbeing or other measurable outcomes that your work will impact? Your work should improve lives, either directly or indirectly.
- principle: Be inclusive 
  summary: |
    NHS services are for everyone. Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your design.
- principle: Design for context 
  summary: |
    Don’t just design your part of a service. Consider people's entire experience, and the infrastructure and processes involved. Think about how people begin and end their time with what you are designing.
- principle: Design for trust
  summary: |
    People trust the NHS. Take care not to jeopardise that. Design things that are reliable and secure.
- principle: Test your assumptions 
  summary: |
    Design and test your work with real people. Observe behaviour and gather evidence. Work with subject experts and existing research. Do not rely on hunches.
- principle: Make, learn, iterate 
  summary: |
    Start small. Experiment with different ways of doing things. Make prototypes to improve your understanding. Test and refine.
- principle: Do the hard work to make it simple
  summary: |
    Healthcare journeys can be complex. Take the time to understand what you are trying to solve. Do not push complexity onto the people using what you are designing.
- principle: Make things open. It makes things better 
  summary: |
    Share your learning. Share your work. Be transparent in your design decisions.

    Be accountable and have confidence in your solutions.

overview: |
   Atlassian is a enterprise software company that develops collaboration software. It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration product, Confluence.
   At Atlassian, we believe that behind every great human achievement, there is a team. We create software to help unlock the power of teamwork and continuously try make our products, websites and integrations better at helping people and teams be more effective.
   These guidelines were put together by a large group of designers from across the organisation to help scale our design craft and to enable designers to create digital experiences that unleash the potential in any team.

principles:
 - principle: Build trust in every interaction
   summary: |
     Trust is earned throughout the Atlassian experience, from our home page to a build's status page. Through the routine tasks and the infrequent. Through the simple and the complicated. In how we respect people's privacy and keep their data private. We follow convention where appropriate, and introduce changes to our products carefully.
     Are we meeting not only people's expectations of functionality and behaviour, but also expectations of reliability, error prevention and recovery, speed, and security in every interaction?
 - principle: Connect people to collaborate better
   summary: |
      Our products are born to bring people together to work in teams, rather than just as individuals. They are as accessible as possible, for any context or range of ability, temporary or permanent. They are as inclusive as possible, increasing confidence to contribute to the team next door or the team across the globe. They are as open as possible, for teams to discover, access, understand, contribute to and share work wherever appropriate.
      Are we encouraging inclusion, accessibility, openness and connecting people to each other and their work?
 - principle: Match purpose and feel familiar
   summary: |
      Our products are individually fit-for-purpose as well as collectively harmonious, with each other as well as other products that people use. Although there's a persistent visual and behavioural similarity, they adapt to people's devices and contexts, rather than being consistent for the sake of consistency.
      Are we balancing the expectation that learned behaviours will carry across products, with the need to adapt appearance and functionality to be more effective?
 - principle: Drive momentum from end to end
   summary: |
      The Atlassian experience respects the work people need to get done, and knows when to advise and when to get out of the way. It considers the progress already made, offers better ways to work, connects the dots between stages of work and the work itself (for example pages, specs, issues and code). It celebrates what’s done, and nudges action on tasks, builds, sprints and drafts.
      Are we considering the whole journey, and anticipating their next step?
 - principle: Guide mastery for greater value
   summary: |
      The faster someone can master a product, the more effective they'll be when they're using that product. Our products are satisfying to master, from the first evaluation through to complex configuration, from onboarding to upgrading, whether doing a task for the first time or after a long time. They gracefully reveal depth over time, and enable discovery over time, as teams' challenges grow. This is always done in a way that keeps people focused on their work, and not how to make our products work.
      Are we revealing greater power only in response to people (both as individuals and teams) needing it?

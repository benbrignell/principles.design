- principle: Make it Direct
  summary: |
    As Alan Cooper states: "Where there is output, let there be input." This is the principle of direct manipulation. For example, instead of going to a separate page to edit content it can be done inline, directly in the context of the page.

- principle: Keep It Lightweight
  summary: |
    It's about keeping a light footprint. When the user interacts with the application it should be in a way that causes the least amount of physical and mental effort. A primary way to create a light footprint is through the use of Contextual Tools.

- principle: Stay on the Page
  summary: |
    The page refresh is generally disruptive to the user's mental flow. The default on the web is to go from page-to-page for every action. Now that we are no longer bound by those technical limitations, we can decide when to keep the user on the page and in the flow.

- principle: Provide an Invitation
  summary: |
    Discoverability is one of the primary challenges for rich interaction on the Web. A feature is useless if users don't discover it. A key way to improve discoverability is to provide invitations. Invitations cue the user to the next level of interaction.

- principle: Use Transitions
  summary: |
    Animations, cinematic effects, and various other types of visual transitions can be powerful techniques to enhance engagement and communication.

- principle: React Immediately
  summary: |
    A responsive interface is an intelligent interface. This principle explores how to make a rich experience by using lively responses.

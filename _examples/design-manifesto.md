link : https://www.designmanifesto.org/
author: Niklaus Gerber
overview:
principles:
 - principle: We focus on our user's needs
   summary: We seek to understand their emotions, feelings and aspirations rather than making assumptions about what they want.
 - principle: We add value and not features
   summary: Every piece of functionality we add to the system should add value for our users.
 - principle: We test and iterate
   summary: We are aware that our solutions are assumptions unless tested with real users. We test hypotheses, learn and improve our ideas.
 - principle: We learn from failure
   summary: We encourage failure, embrace setbacks, and allow mistakes. We learn, iterate and grow from them.
 - principle: We are obvious
   summary: The experiences we craft are obvious, transparent and inevitable. We go the extra mile to make the experience feel predictably inevitable.
 - principle: We are consistent
   summary: We are consistent with our designs, the language we use on interfaces, our code and our data. We understand that consistency will make our design better, easier to use, and practically invisible.
 - principle: We make it usable and attractive
   summary: We care about how our solutions look and feel. We make our work pleasant to look at, and a delight to interact with.
 - principle: We make it accessible and inclusive
   summary: Everything we build should be accessible, responsive and inclusive. We sacrifice elegance over inclusiveness, readability and legibility.
 - principle: We imbue ownership
   summary: We imbue ownership with reliability, clear privacy and control. We design experiences for the right type of ownership.
 - principle: We design with data
   summary: We embrace data-driven decision-making. We make sure analytics are built-in and always on.
 - principle: We collaborate
   summary: We tackle problems together. We listen, we understand, and we encourage rather than force solutions. We learn from each other and understand the value of what we are building.
 - principle: We make it shareable and reusable
   summary: If we have found a way of doing something that works, we share it whenever we can instead of reinventing the wheel every time.
 - principle: We acknowledge that design never stops
   summary: Design is an ongoing imperative. We listen to user feedback and make data-driven decisions to refine and improve our product.

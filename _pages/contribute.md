## Submissions

If you want to add a set of design principles to the collection then great, and thanks! To ensure your subission is accepted please consider the following guidelines:

### Guidelines

Submissions need to contain the following:

* A set of **original Design Principles**
* A **source article**, **blog post** or **canonical page** listing a set of design principles in more detail. Along with the principles themselves, a source article would contain something about how you or your team came up with these principles. Consider a few of the following questions:

  - How did you decide on what your design principles should be?
  - What you did you learn?
  - What worked, what didn’t work?
  - How do you follow these principles?
  - Have these principles made your process better?
  - If so, how?

You don't need to cover all these things in detail. Overall we want to know the **story behind how you created your principles**.

Here are some great examples of those that do this:

* [Airbnb](https://airbnb.design/the-way-we-build/)
* [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
* [Josh Clark's "Design in the Era of the Algorithm"](https://bigmedium.com/speaking/design-in-the-era-of-the-algorithm.html)

You can submit examples from other individuals, companies or teams that you think would be useful to the community.

For more information and documentation about how to submit [take a look at the GitHub page](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

## Help needed

Each set of principles in [examples](/examples) should contain the following things:
* Overview
* Summary of each principle
* Source URL
* Author/creator
* Tags

If any of these things are missing you'll see a "Help needed" message at the bottom of the page highlighting which things are missing.

If you want to help [visit the GitHub page for more info](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing).

## Roadmap
Take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/benbrignell/design-principles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap) and feel free to comment or add suggestions.

title: Blend Design Principles
author: Blend
overview: Principles provide a framework to consistently craft experiences that are unique to our team and our values. They should help us make decisions quicker and with purpose.
principles:
- principle: Start with the story
  summary: |
    Since design decisions are geared toward solving a problem, always begin by understanding the objectives and intended outcomes of a project.
      
      - Content drives design: Whether it’s gathering research insights, collaborating on a spec, or aligning on a narrative, first lay a foundational outline or journey map to guide decisions.
      - Present with intent: Good design is transparent, obvious, and honest. Aim to maximize comprehension while minimizing decoration.

- principle: Advocate for your audience
  summary: |
   Bringing clarity to the confusing industry of consumer finance means deeply understanding the mindset and motivations of our users in order to champion the best experiences for them.
      
      - Content drives design: Guide with purpose and ease: Craft interactions that are intentional, effortless, and guide toward the correct path the first time. Remove excess burden whenever possible, but always favor clarity over clicks.
      - Leave no one behind: Our mission is to enable broader access to financial services. Embrace standards and patterns that ensure the fullest spectrum of usability and comprehension, and always seek to empower through education.


- principle: Consider every scenario
  summary: |
    Building a configurable platform to span millions of borrowers across hundreds of unique lenders requires a concise and flexible design language.
      
      - Favor systems and reusable parts: Patterns that comprise a consistent and efficient framework help to improve comprehension and performance, and allow our work to scale across different configurations, platforms, and devices.
      - Situate your work in the real world: Optimize a design for where its impact will be felt most, considering its most distant end-state or use case.
      

- principle: Build a bridge to the future
  summary: |
    Reinventing an industry requires innovative approaches, but in order to drive adoption of new paradigms, both their function and value must be easily understood.
      
      - Make the new feel familiar: Turn to proven patterns whenever possible. With novel interactions or concepts, consider adapting or enhancing existing mental models in unique ways.
      - Design beyond the display: Appreciate a feature's potential value over its functional interface, always seeking to leverage technology, automation, or other tools to streamline an experience.
